Granting privileges to standard user
Add the user to the 'Administrators' group
We tested by logging on as the new user

Sharing Folders
Share name: test
Default share permissions: Allow Everyone to Read

Any user
Able to open/read any files in the shared folder but couldn't write/save or create.

Users in "Uppity Supervisors"
Able to read and write files.
Not able to write in files already created by another user.

Users in the Administrator group or Uppity Supervisors group were able to read and write files because we set the permissions while sharing the folder.
User not in the "Uppity Supervisors" group can't write files but are able to read them.

Summary
We learned how to find common server information, such as Computer name, OS version, Memory, Processor and so on.
We also learned how to manage local Users and Groups, sharing folders and setting the appropriate folder permissions, so only allowed users can read/write files on the shared folder.
We didn't have to make any decision that would affect the lab results.
